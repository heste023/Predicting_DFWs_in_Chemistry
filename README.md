This script is the first-level analysis that I did while working 
as an analyst in the Provost's office at The University of Alabama.
Our department was asked, generally, to help the Chemistry department
understand the key drivers of success for the intro-level chemistry
courses required for majors and medical students. In the end, we
chose a glmnet model to forecast student grades in the courses, 
identified the key features of student-success (unsurprisingly,
related to academic preparation; surprisingly, not related to 
standardized test scores), and communicating those 
results to institutional leadership in the Provost's office.
